# Graph is a test task was required while applying to the position backend support in Schwarzthal Tech
## The task:

You should develop a Rails application that allows viewing and editing a single graph.
An user should be able to create a node in the graph with label and some data (the format of
this data will be discussed later), edit a node (change label and data), remove node, create and
remove an edge (a directed link between two nodes).
The data of a node must be presented as a dictionary (a set of key-value pairs). Note that keys
can be not unique.
An example of data:

| Key | Value |
|----------|----------|
| Email address | contact@example.com |
| Email address 1 | contact2@example.com |
| Phone | +7 (999) 123-45-67 |
| Contact time | 14:00-19:00 Mon-Fri |


This application does not need frontend, you should provide a GraphQL API instead
